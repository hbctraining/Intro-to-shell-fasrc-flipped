### Before the next class:

1. Please **study the contents** and **work through all the code** within the following lessons:

  * [Wildcards and shortcuts in Shell](../lessons/02_wildcards_shortcuts.md)
  * [Examining and creating files](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/03_working_with_files.html)
  * [Searching and redirection](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/04_searching_files.html)
  * [Shell scripts and variables in Shell](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-shell-flipped/lessons/05_shell-scripts_variable.html)

> **NOTE:** To run through the code above, you will need to be **logged into O2** and **working on a compute node** (i.e. your command prompt should have the word `compute` in it).
> 1. Log in using `ssh rc_trainingXX@o2.hms.harvard.edu` and enter your password (replace the "XX" in the username with the number you were [assigned in class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxpzu5NU20y_Wh4ILZXa9YRh6JzXulTulaoOJ0mmNTs/edit#gid=0)). 
> 2. Once you are on the login node, use `srun --pty -p interactive -t 0-2:30 --mem 1G /bin/bash` to get on a compute node.
> 3. Proceed once your command prompt has the word `compute` in it.
> 4. If you log out between lessons (using the `exit` command twice), please follow points 1. and 2. above to log back in and get on a compute node when you restart with the self learning.

2. **Complete the exercises**:
   * Each lesson above contain exercises; please go through each of them.
   * **Copy over** your the answers for the exercises into a plain text file on your local computer, using Notepad++, TextWrangler or similar. 
     * *Please do not copy all of the content from your Terminal, just the answers.*
   * **Upload the text file** to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/request/a4C5YfsulgFP5te9e7mY) the **day before the next class**.

### Questions?
* ***If you get stuck due to an error*** while runnning code in the lesson, [email us](mailto:hbctraining@hsph.harvard.edu) 
* Post any **conceptual questions** that you would like to have **reviewed in class** [here](https://PollEv.com/hbctraining945).

General help:
* Google it! - if you don't know how to do something, try Googling it, other people have probably had the same question.
* Learn by doing! There's no real other way to learn this than by trying it out.
  * Use vim on your laptop
  * Move around the directory structure on your laptop using the Terminal/Shell counts
  * Open folders and files using the command `open`
  * Automate something you don't really need to automate
* Use `man bash` to get more information about bash (bourne-again shell)
