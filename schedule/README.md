General help:
* Google it! - if you don't know how to do something, try Googling it, other people have probably had the same question.
* Learn by doing! There's no real other way to learn this than by trying it out.
  * Use vim on your laptop
  * Move around the directory structure on your laptop using the Terminal/Shell counts
  * Open folders and files using the command `open`
  * Automate something you don't really need to automate
* Use `man bash` to get more information about bash (bourne-again shell)
