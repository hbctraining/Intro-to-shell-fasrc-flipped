# Introduction to Shell and Cluster computing (FAS-RC's compute cluster)

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the necessity for, and use of, the command line interface (bash/shell).

## Installations

***Mac users:***
No installation requirements.  
***Windows users:***
[GitBash](https://git-scm.com/download/win)  

## Notes
* These materials focus on the use of local computational resources at Harvard, which are **only accessible to Harvard affiliates**
* Non-Harvard folks can [download the data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3lua2h1oo18gbug/unix_lesson.tar.gz?dl=1) and set up to work on their local clusters (with the help of local system administrators)

General help:
* Google it! - if you don't know how to do something, try Googling it, other people have probably had the same question.
* Learn by doing! There's no real other way to learn this than by trying it out.
  * Use vim on your laptop
  * Move around the directory structure on your laptop using the Terminal/Shell counts
  * Open folders and files using the command `open`
  * Automate something you don't really need to automate
* Use `man bash` to get more information about bash (bourne-again shell)
